# Interesting Projects for my TEALS students

## Song Recommender with the Spotify API

### What's this?
This is a console app written in C# (very similar to Java) which uses your Spotify App to talk to the Spotify API and recommend you 10 songs that are very close to a song you give it.

### What do I learn here?
You will learn how to use an API.

### How do I make it work?
1. Get the code (either clone the repo or download the project)
2. Make you own Spotify App (you will need a Spotify account for this, but first time users get the first month for free - as long as you remember to cancel the membership)
3. Put your Spotify app name and key in the code
4. Compile and Run. Results will be in the console output.
